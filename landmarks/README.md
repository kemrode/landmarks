## Apple Basic SwiftUI Exercise

The first basic SwitUI exercise from Apple to learn how SwiftUI works.
I added some changes from the exercise to test some Text, spacer or divider and create a strange little story aabout a famous non-existing Emperor of the DarkLight Realm.

Hope that you enjoy to see this too ;)
